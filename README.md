How do you run tests?
    I click the play button to run my code located in the middle of the tool bar at the top of the page.

Any tests of note?
    I entered tea to "add to my order", it worked. If I entered something incorrect it would say that item isn't on the menu and asks to try again.

Describe any tests that you did not complete?
    I completed all tests
